# Functional Cake Cutting With Haskell

Dissertation project implementing classic cake-cutting algorithms in Haskell. Project includes a model for agents and cake objects, as well as cutting, assignment, and evaluation functions. This model is then demonstrated on three different cake-cutting algorithms using different types of fairness on different numbers of agents.
